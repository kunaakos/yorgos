# `@yorgos/experimental`

It is an experiment in writing an actor framework in TypeScript that allows one to create apps that are distributed across: processes, tabs, iframes, workers, embedded devices, serverless functions - in any combination.

It aims to be simple and modular, with the least amount of dependencies possible.

It's still in its infancy, and not intended for production use, but is unique in its ability to create actor networks that span from tiny edge devices to apps running in datacenters sharing the same code, while using your preferred networking/messaging tools

The [project repo's Readme](https://github.com/kunaakos/yorgos) has a complete guide.
