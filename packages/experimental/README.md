# `@yorgos/experimental`

It is an experiment in writing an actor framework in TypeScript that allows one to create apps that are distributed across: processes, tabs, iframes, workers, embedded devices, serverless functions - in any combination.

It aims to be simple and modular, with the least amount of dependencies possible, which allows you to have actors running on tiny and cheap SoCs while effortlessly communicating with the rest of the application.

The [project repo's Readme](https://github.com/kunaakos/yorgos) has a complete guide.

It's still in its infancy, and not intended for production use.
